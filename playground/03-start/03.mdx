## 03. Sharing Code Across Projects in a Monorepo

Task: Run code from one package inside another package. Make each project into an ESM project. Install package number 2 into package 1. Run `pnpm install` and take a look at files in the node_modules folder.

Note: ESM stands for ECMAScript Modules. It's a standard for working with modules in JavaScript. Modules are reusable pieces of code that can be exported from one program and imported for use in another program. ESM is the official standard format to package JavaScript code for reuse. Modules are defined using a variety of import and export statements.

This is the core of working in a monorepo!

Your task is to:

1. Convert each project into an ESM (ECMAScript Module) module.
2. Install the `firelane-two` package into the `firelane-one`. You should be able to run `firelane-two` inside the `index.js` file of `firelane-one`. You will need to adjust the code to be exported from `firelane-two`.
3. Explore the `node_modules` created at the root directory and in the `firelane-one` package.

**The goal is to run code from one package inside another package.**

1. Convert each project into an ESM (ECMAScript Module) module.

Although it's not required to use ECMAScript Modules (ESM) for this task, it is the recommended modern standard for Node.js projects.

Add this to both packages:

```json
"type": "module"
```

> Note: We don't have to do this in the main `package.json`.

2. Install the `firelane-two` package into the `firelane-one` package using `pnpm install`.

Inside `firelane-one`, add the dependency:

```json
 "dependencies": {
    "@forestpark/firelane-two": "workspace:*"
  },
```

> We can specify the version directly.

You should be able to use `firelane-two` inside the `firelane-one` `index.js` file. You will need to adjust the code to be exported from `firelane-two`:

```js
export function calculateHikingTime(trailLength, averageSpeed) {
  return trailLength / averageSpeed
}
```

Adding the export allows you to access this package as you would with any third-party package.

> Run `pnpm install` at the root of the workspace.

3. Explore the `node_modules` created at the root directory and in `package one`.

When you run `pnpm install`, it creates `node_modules` directories at the root and inside `firelane-one`. These directories contain symbolic links to the actual packages.

4. Import our installed package.

```js
import {calculateHikingTime} from '@forestpark/firelane-two'

calculateHikingTime()
```

This treats it as any other dependency.

5. Run `firelane-one` from the root:

```
pnpm -r --filter @forestpark/firelane-one run start
```

> We are now officially able to work in two projects at once! We can use code from one project inside another. This is the core of working in a monorepo. ðŸ˜„

> Whether we start working with React, Svelte, etc., it doesn't matter. All that matters is that we have a `package.json` file, allowing us to work across projects as if they were all inside one codebase.
